            an HTML Developer. So, you're at this website because I either
            forced you to, or you stumbled upon it. Either way, this is still a
            pretty nice website with some fancy transitions and themes. Now,
            before I get carried away by ranting about how awesome my website
            is(n't) I'd like to explain the reason why I built this website in
            the first place...<br>
            <br>
            For people like <b>YOU</b> to be able to be taught by a <b>NERD</b>
            who pretty much breathes this HTML stuff. I make it easy, fun, and
            really, really annoying by trying to say funny stuff. However, I
            iron out early misconceptions and teach good practices. As a
            beginner, diving into the murky waters of HTML Development was
            confusing, and I had thousands of questions. Now you can learn from
            me, so I can <s>google</s> answer all of your questions.<br>
