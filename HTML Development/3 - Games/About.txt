About: Games
The game folder is a very important folder. It is used for managing projects, and categorizing them.
  - Finished
   Games that are complete, and distributed. They can also be played.
  - Unfinished
   Games that are actively being worked on.
  - Abandonned
   Games that will never be worked on again. They were either too difficult, or a new idea was created during development
