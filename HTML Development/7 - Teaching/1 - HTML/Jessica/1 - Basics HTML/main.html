       <!-- HTML STYLING RULE OF LE DAY
       NEVER
       EVER
       USE INLINE STYLES:       What are inline styles, you ask? Well, its when you use the style attribute to set styles in the HTML document. Its convenient and spares you the confusion of having to go into the CSS file, but if you use it too much your HTML document turns into a hunk of repeating crap and despair. So, juust create a CSS class for each flavor of element, and link em together. You may use it again, and it keeps your code a whole lot cleaner. Cha'feel?-->
