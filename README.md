# TheGenieOfTruth.github.io
This is a repo in where I slap together broken HTML files to make something that might resemble a website if you cross your eyes.
```
CI: Complete, needs standard file link (Good meta tags, favicons, etc.)
C: Complete (Done. No touchy)
D: Under development (An open area in which edits will occasionally be added)
O: Ongoing development (An area in which will never be completed, as has an eternal purpose)
A: Mostly abandoned (This is never going to finish, ever)
